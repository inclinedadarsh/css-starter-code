## About:
This repository includes a CSS starter file and snippets for different Editors such as VS Code, Sublime Text and Atom.
You can use these snippets to get a Head Start writing your CSS!

It includes some much-needed already-written code for **`margin`**, **`padding`** & **`box-sizing`**, **`font-family`** & **`font-size`**, **`color`** & **`background-color`**, and **much more!**

The **Best Part** about the code is it has **Modern Variables!!!** which keeps the code clean and make it easy for you to make the website responsive.
Yes! It has **`media-queries`** too!

## Inspiration:
I ([Adarsh Dubey](https://adarshdubey.netlify.app)) was going to start a new project untill I realised the [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) has made life so much easier by providing a HTML starter just on click of an Exclamation! Mark, but I have to start from scratch for CSS. I searched for starter codes and I found only a few which were full of unnecessary code which definitely makes the website load slower than it should. Also, there were no CSS Variables (I mean how can they do that!). **Also, none of them were open source where web-devs can request what they want.**

So I decided to make a VS Code snippet for myself until I realised I can make a Github repository where I can provide all that I make. Ain't that a Beautifull Idea?
